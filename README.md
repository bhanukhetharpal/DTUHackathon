# WeFlo
This is a prototype of the WebApp that I am working on currently along with the tech team of Project Dharini under Enactus IGDTUW.
## The problem WeFlo solves:
- WeFLo is a counselling and educative platform specially built to take a step towards educating everyone on the various aspects of menstruation and fertility.
- We'd be connecting our users to counsellors and expert doctors who'd try to answer any questions that they might have related to their own and others' body functions corresponding to menstruation. 
- Our open forum would help initiate a healthy discussion between the users. Anonymity of users would be maintained at all times, so that they would be able to freely communicate on our website.
